      There were reports of heavy rain in the states of Goa, Karnataka and Maharashtra as well. Tauktae resulted in at least 90 deaths in India and left another 81 people missing. 
      There were also 5 deaths reported in Pakistan. The storm displaced over 200,000 people in Gujarat. The cyclone also caused widespread infrastructure and agricultural damages to the western coast of India. 
      32 fishermen were lost at sea when their boats were caught in the cyclone. Mumbai also experienced impacts from the storm, with airports being closed for safety reasons. 
      The city experienced their highest ever recorded wind gust at 114 km/h (70 mph). Power outages and other electrical problems also prevailed in the impacted regions. 
      The cyclone made landfall in Gujarat the same day as India recorded its, at the time, highest single-day COVID death toll, with 4,329 deaths reported.

      <br><br>The cyclone also caused a large amount of maritime incidents as it moved along the coast of western India. Hundreds were missing from various barges, however, most of them have been rescued.
